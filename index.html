        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover - B), was a
          robotic rover that was part of
          <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's</a> Mars
          Exploration Rover program. It landed on Mars on January 25, 2004,
          three weeks after its twin, Spirit (MER-A), touched down on the
          opposite side of the planet. <br /><br />Opportunity's primary mission
          was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils
          that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The rover exceeded its
          planned 90-day mission duration by far, continuing its exploration and
          scientific discoveries for nearly 15 years until communication was
          lost on June 10, 2018. <br /><br />Opportunity made groundbreaking
          discoveries about the Red Planet's geology and environment, including
          evidence that Mars once had conditions that could have supported
          microbial life.

        <h3>Discoveries</h3>

        <p>Blueberries on Mars</p>
        <p>
          The rover discovered small spherical objects, nicknamed "blueberries,"
          which are hematite-rich spherules. These provided strong evidence that
          liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars, as they are believed
          to have formed in wet ground conditions.

        <p>Heat Shield Rock</p>
        <p>
          Discovered in January 2005, this was the first meteorite ever
          identified on another planet. Officially named "Meridiani Planum," it
          is an iron meteorite about the size of a basketball. The discovery was
          significant because it provided direct evidence of meteoritic material
          on Mars, offering clues about the history of meteorite impacts on the
          planet and the composition of materials in the solar system.

        <p>Sulfate-rich Sandstones</p>
        <p>
          Opportunity discovered sulfate-rich sandstones at various locations,
          including the Meridiani Planum. These sandstones were indicative of
          the presence of acidic water in the past. Sulfates form in liquid
          water environments, and their abundance suggested that Mars had
          long-standing, possibly stationary, bodies of water such as lakes or
          shallow seas that were acidic.
